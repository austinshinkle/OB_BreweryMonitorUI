# :beer: Ostentatious Brewing Brewery Monitor UI
## Introduction
This application is to be used in conjunction with OB_BreweryMonitor located here: https://github.com/austinshinkle/OB_BreweryMonitor. It connects to the web socket generated by OB_BreweryMonitor, which gathers all the sensor data, and uses NiceGUI (nicegui.io) to visualize the data. Additionally, it connects to the Ostentatious Brewing Website (https://ostentatiousbrewing.wixsite.com/ostentatiousbrewing), which stores beer recipes and information so that it can populate statistics in the monitoring UI.
